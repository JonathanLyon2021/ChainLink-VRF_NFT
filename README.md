# ChainLink-VRF_NFT
This is an example of Chainlink's VRF verifiable random function which returns a verifiable random number. 
I implemented this using an NFT so that way we can use random numbers to get the characters height, weight, dexterity, etc. 
Each characers have different random numbers for all of their levels. This code does not work currently, I will update this repo in a few moths to get it working.
Thank you for viewing my repository!
